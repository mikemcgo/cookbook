comments:
- scales linearly except for filtering
ingredients:
- 2 oz bourbon (not too nice, this will de-identify it)
- 3/4 oz strained lemon juice
- 3/4 oz 2:1 simple syrup
- 1 oz milk
steps:
- stir all but the milk
- add cocktail to milk
- strain through coffee filter - do not get impatience, if your batch is too big,
  consider breaking it into smaller batches - or invent some crazy drip system
- when ready to serve, stir with ice
